| Standup                                              | Technique popular in the agile development process where a short daily meeting is held where every team member reviews their work and any impediments. Physical standing is preferred to keep the meeting short.             |
| Retrospective                                        | A meeting held at the end of  a sprint to discuss and decide on process improvements. A core part of an agile software development process.                                                                                  |
| Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)                          | A software development maxim to avoid creating multiple instances of redundant code. When similar code is needed in two different places prefer to use one of the abstraction features of your programming language.         |
| You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)                      | A programming maxim to avoid coding things that you don't have a direct and immediate need for because in all likelihood, things will change and you will not end up needing it.                                             |
| Law of Demeter / Principle of least knowledge        | Programming rule-of-thumb that a piece of code should minimize how much it needs to know about how any other piece of code works. Ideally, code should only know about and talk to the structures it uses directly.          |
| Single Responsibility Principle                      | Programing principle that a unit of code (function/class/script) should ideally have one responsibility. The only reason it should change is if one of its business requirements change. The S in SOLID.                     |
| Open/Closed Priniciple                               | Programming principle that a unit of code should be easy (open) to extend if requirements are added but only need to change (closed) if its own business requirements change. The O in SOLID.                                |
| Liskov Subsitution Principle                         | Object oriented design principle that a subclass should not substantively change (though additional behavior is fine) behavior in a superclass. The L in SOLID.                                                              |
| Interface Segregation Principle                      | Object oriented design principle stating that an interface should only expose methods that are likely to be used at the same time. Implementing many interfaces is fine, but interfaces should be small. The I in SOLID.     |
| Dependency Inversion Principle                       | Object oriented design principle that code components (function/class/script) should not directly reference other components but should be passed in via a module or constructor injection system. The D in SOLID.           |

| Unit Testing                                         | Development technique for improving code quality. Automated tests are written to call a small bit of code and verify its behavior. The definition of unit is often debated, but tends to be small and highly focused.        |
| Test Driven Development (TDD)                        | Practice of writing testing code - typically unit tests - before implementing features. Can result in better quality software design as it forces requirements to be stated and understood very explicitly.                  |
| Behavior Driven Development (BDD)                    | Style of test driven development with an emphasis on naming tests in a style that business people can understand. Defines a unit testing unit as a concrete behavior or feature that business people care about.             |
| Integration tests                                    | Automated tests that validate proper behavior of multiple parts of the system together. Often used to test how the user interface interacts with the back end by mimicking a user interacting with the application.          |
| Automated testing                                    | The practice of writing automated checks that code functions as it should. Includes unit testing, approval testing, integration testing, and an outher automation.                                                           |
| Executable Specification                             | A subset of BDD where developers create mini programming languages that are simple enough for business people to specify - or at least be able to understand the code - of how a program should behave.                      |
| Acceptance testing                                   | Testing conducted by the product owner of quality assurance team with the specific goal of accepting the feature as completed or not.                                                                                        |
| Quality Assurance (QA)                               | A role and typically a job position for someone who tests that software works as it should. Can be anywhere from bottom-of-the-totem to a specialist who is integral part of the software development process.               |
| Code Coverage                                        | An automated tool that measures what percentage of your codebase is executed by automated tests. Sometimes used as a metric of quality but high ratings can be misleading.                                                   |
| Mutation Testing                                     | A tool that modifies code and runs tests repeatedly. If code can be modified significantly and tests still pass then flagged for further investigation. Useful for finding missed use cases automatically.                   |
| Microsoft                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
